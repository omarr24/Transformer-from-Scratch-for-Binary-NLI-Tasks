# Transformer from Scratch for Binary Natural Language Inference (NLI) Tasks

This repository presents a complete implementation of a transformer model, built from scratch, designed specifically for binary Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. In these tasks, the model classifies sentence pairs into one of two classes: entailment or contradiction.

## Contents

- **Custom Transformer Architecture**: An encoder-only transformer model implemented from scratch, following the foundational principles of the transformer architecture.
- **Binary NLI Task**: Application of the model to binary NLI tasks, where it predicts either entailment or contradiction for pairs of sentences.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Code for training the model on binary NLI datasets and assessing its accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Additional libraries: NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-binary-nli.git
